# Advent of Code 2020 - **ReScript** - Day 2

Implemented from default ReScript template. Changed to output mjs rather than commonjs.

## Features

- Includes Run.mjs in repo since it's a community best practice when using **ReScript**
- Uses Belt for Set and Array functionality
- Generates `.mjs` files rather than `.bs.js` ones because I prefer it that way :)
- Uses esbuild to create a single bundle with all dependencies included (12k un-minified if you're curious)

## Building

```sh
npm run build
```

## Running

```
npm start
```
